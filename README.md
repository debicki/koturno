#### *"We will check for you if your host is working."* ;)
Koturno is a host availability checker. Simple web interface, possibility to add, modify, grouping and removing hosts, 
viewing history of inaccessibility are powers of that application. 

#### Restrictions
At the moment the user interface is only in Polish.

### Usage
After running the application we can connect with it via an internet browser. The first opened page will by a simple 
dashboard, but the interface offers three other main pages. First from them is a list of all hosts in the database, 
where we can manage hosts. Second, give us the possibility to view and manage host groups. Third shows the history of 
all inaccessibility.
